## UART 32-Bit Floating Point Multiplier (VHDL) for Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8

### Overview:
This project presents a VHDL implementation of a 32-bit floating point multiplier, tailored for use with the Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8 FPGA board. The multiplier is designed to execute floating-point multiplication operations using the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication protocol.

### Features:
- Implements a 32-bit floating-point multiplier capable of handling floating-point numbers.
- Incorporates UART communication protocol for seamless interfacing with external devices or systems.
- Optimized for the Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8 FPGA, leveraging efficient resource utilization and performance.

### Key Components:
- **Floating Point Multiplier:** Executes IEEE 754 floating-point multiplication with support for 32-bit floating-point numbers.
- **UART Interface:** Facilitates asynchronous serial communication for transmitting and receiving data with external devices.

### Compatibility:
- Tailored specifically for the Cyclone II EP2C5T144C8 FPGA board.
- VHDL codebase can be synthesized using Quartus II or any compatible FPGA synthesis toolchain.
